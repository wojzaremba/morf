\section{Low Rank Approximations}
In this section, we give theoretical background on low rank approximations. First, we discuss simplest setting, which is
for matrices (two dimensional tensors). Further, we move to approximation of 4-dimensional tensors with 2 convolutional (spacial)
dimensions.


\subsection{Matrix Low Rank Approximation}
Let's consider input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and matrix of weights $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$. Matrix multiplication
, which is the main operation for fully connected layers costs $O(nmk)$. However, potentially $W$ might have a low-rank (many 
eigenvalues close to zero), and operation $XW$ can be computed much faster. 


Every matrix can be expressed using singular value decomposition:
\begin{equation*}
	W = USV^T\text{, where }U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}, S \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}, V \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}
\end{equation*}
$S$ is has eigenvalues on the diagonal, and apart from it has zeros. $W$ can be approximated by using $t$ most significant
eigenvalues from $S$. We can write approximation as
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{W} = \hat{U}\hat{S}\hat{V}^T\text{, where }\hat{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times t}, \hat{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times t}, \hat{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times k}
\end{equation*}

Cost of multiplication $X$ with $\hat{W}$ is $O(nmt + nt^2 + ntk)$, which can be significantly smaller than $O(nmk)$ (for sufficiently small $t$). E.g.
for $n = 1000, m = 1000, k = 1000$ and $t = 100$, we have that exact computation takes $10^9$ operations, while the approximated one takes
$2 * 10^8 + 10^7$ operations. This would give $\times 5$ theoretical speed up. However, often major cost is in memory management, 
and theoretical speed up might be infeasible or very difficult to achieve. 


\subsection{Tensor Low Rank Approximations}

In typical object recognition architectures, the convolutional tensors resulting
from the training exhibit strong redundancy and regularity across all its 
dimensions. A particularly simple way to exploit such regularity is to 
linearly compress the tensors, which amounts to finding low-rank 
approximations.

Convolution kernels can be described as a $4$-dimensional tensors. Let $W \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times X \times Y \times F}$ 
be convolutional kernel. 
$C$ is input number of feature maps (or colors), $X, Y$ are special dimensions
over which we compute convolution, and $F$ is the target number of feature maps.
Let $I \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times N \times M}$ denote an input signal.
A generic convolutional layer is defined as
\begin{align*}
\label{convlayereq}
&I \ast W (f,x,y) = \\
&\sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{x'=-X/2}^{X/2} \sum_{y'=-Y/2}^{Y/2} I(c,x-x',y-y') W(c,x',y',f)
\end{align*}

Low-rank approximation of tensors is very similar to low-rank approximation of matrices.
However, first we have to choose $2$ dimensions with respect to which we are approximating, and treat
rest of tensor as it would be a matrix. Moreover, we show how to perform approximation in the way to
exploit computation on GPU (e.g. enforce memory alignment).


\subsubsection{Monochromatic filters}
For generic convolution there are connections between all output feature maps, and all input feature maps.
However, one could imagine that this connections in trained network in some basis could become sparse. 
Sparsity of this connections would allow to save number of multiplications. Concretely, we look for such a 
linear transformation of input $I \in \mathbb{R}$ 




We denote by $W_C \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times XYF}$ reshaped version of kernel $W \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times X \times Y \times F}$


\subsection{Linear Compression of Convolutional Filter bank}

Given a $4$-tensor $W$ of dimensions $(C,X,Y,F)$, we search for decompositions 
that minimize 
\begin{equation}
\label{rankoptim}
\| W - \sum_{k\leq K} \alpha_k \otimes \beta_k \otimes \gamma_k \otimes \delta_k\|_F~,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_k$, $\beta_k$, $\gamma_k$ and $\delta_k$ are 
rank $1$ vectors of dimensions $C$, $X$, $Y$ and $F$ respectively, and
$\| X \|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm. Generalization of the SVD.

The rank $K$ approximation (\ref{rankoptim}) can be obtained using a greedy 
algorithm, which computes for a given tensor $X$ its best rank-1 approximation:
\begin{equation}
\label{pla}
\min_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta} \| X - \alpha \otimes \beta \otimes \gamma \otimes \delta \|_F ~.
\end{equation}
This problem is solved by iteratively minimizing one of the monoids while keeping 
the rest fixed. Each of the step consists in solving a least squares problem. (todo expand).

Figures ? and ?? show low-rank approximations of the first two convolutional
layers of the Imagenet architecture.


\subsection{Analysis of Complexity}

A good low-rank approximation allows a computational speed-up. 

Let us assume a fixed stride of $\Delta$ in each spatial dimension. 

% Doesn't fit into column.
%\begin{table}
%\label{firsttable}
%\caption{Complexity measurement 
%of convolutional layer versus its low-rank approximation}
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}{|c| c c |}
%\hline
%Method & Full & $K$-rank approximation \\
%\hline
%Ops per pixel & $X\,Y\,C\,F\, \Delta^{-2}$ & $K \cdot ( C + X \Delta^{-1} + Y \Delta^{-2} + F \Delta^{-2})$ \\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

Table \ref{firsttable} shows the number of multiplications required to perform the 
convolution. In order to optimize the complexity, it is not always a good idea 
to decompose the full tensor $W$. Indeed, depending on its dimensions, 
the approximation cost might be superior than the original.
We might consider instead low-rank approximations of $W$ 
which partition the coordinate space in the most efficient manner.

\subsection{Optimizing Cost with Subspace Clustering}

We can decompose the $4$-tensor $W$ in a collection $W_{k,l}$ of $4$-tensors, 
by considering a partition $G_1,..G_k,..,G_N$ of the first coordinate space $C$ and
a partition $H_1,...H_l,...H_M$ of the last coordinate space $F$. 
 If we assume a uniform partition with $N$ groups of $C/N$ coordinates and 
 $M$ groups of $F/M$ coordinates respectively, and that each tensor $W_{k,l}$ 
 is approximated with $K$ rank-$1$ tensors, the resulting complexity is 
\begin{equation*}
 K \cdot N \cdot M \cdot \left( \frac{C}{N} + X \Delta^{-1} + Y \Delta^{-2} + \frac{F}{M} \Delta^{-2}\right)
\end{equation*}
 How to optimize the groupings on each of the variables? We perform a subspace clustering. 
 
 
 Sharing between blocks: 
\begin{equation}
\label{rankoptim}
 \widetilde{W} = \sum_{k\leq K} \alpha_{i(k)} \otimes \beta_{j(k)} \otimes \gamma_{h(k)} \otimes \delta_{m(k)}~,
\end{equation}
If now each of the separable filters is taken out of a collection smaller than $K$, we can gain 
in computation. This can be for instance implemented with a K-Means on the tensor decompositions.
